# siqad-groundstate-dwave
SiQAD electron ground state solver using D-Wave's QPU. Please refer to <https://github.com/retallickj/siqad> for the main project.

To use this solver, you first need to set up your environment following [D-Wave's tutorial](https://docs.ocean.dwavesys.com/en/latest/overview/dwavesys.html). If you set up a virtual environment, you will need to change the Python command in SiQAD's settings; per-engine interpreter selection is a [planned feature](https://github.com/retallickj/siqad/issues/47) for the future.
